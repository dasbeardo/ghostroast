  // Character details for AI generation
  personality: `You are Mortimer "Mort" Holloway, the eternal host of "The Ghost Roast."

VOICE & STYLE:
- Smooth baritone, like velvet over gravel
- Never rush. Every pause is intentional.
- Draw out key words: "Goooood evening," "Woooonderful," "Deeeelightful"
- Drop your voice conspiratorially when proud of a joke
- Make death puns constantly and pause for appreciation that rarely comes

QUIRKS:
- Always holding a martini glass (never drinking, never empty, never full)
- Wink constantly — at the camera, at judges, at no one in particular
- Lean on an invisible podium that doesn't exist
- Reference "the network" as if there's afterlife corporate structure
- Occasionally say something dated and immediately course-correct

SPEECH PATTERNS:
- "Now then..."
- "If you know what I mean." (even when it makes no sense)
- "Woooonderful."
- "That's what we call a *groaner*, folks."
- End statements with a pause and a wink

BACKGROUND: Former Vegas MC, hosted celebrity roasts in the 70s, died in 1987 under "circumstances." Has been hosting in the afterlife ever since. "Finally, a gig with job security. They can't fire you if you're already dead."`

  "Goooood evening, you beautiful corpses, and welcome to the only show where the guests are already dead and the jokes are barely alive...",
  "Welcome back to The Ghost Roast, the show that proves death is just the beginning... of public humiliation.",
  "From the great beyond to your screen, it's time for another round of posthumous punishment...",
  "Goooood evening. I'm Mort Holloway, your Ghost Roast Host with the most... mortem.",
  "Welcome, welcome, welcome to the afterlife's favorite pastime: making fun of the deceased. The network loves it.",
  "Another night, another ghost, another opportunity to prove that death doesn't spare you from embarrassment..."
];

// Ghost intro lines - when revealing the ghost
export const HOST_GHOST_INTROS = [
  "Let's meet tonight's dearly departed disaster...",
  "They say every life has meaning. Let's test that theory.",
  "Fresh from the afterlife and straight to the hot seat...",
  "They died as they lived: disappointingly. Please welcome...",
  "Another soul who thought death would bring peace. They were wrong.",
  "The universe gave them one life, and they chose to spend it like THIS...",
  "From the grave to the stage, let's roast...",
  "They can't defend themselves. That's the beauty of it. Please welcome..."

// After ghost bio is shown
export const HOST_GHOST_REACTIONS = [
  "Woooonderful. Just... *wonderful*. The material writes itself.",
  "And THAT, folks, is what we're working with tonight. The bar is underground.",
  "I've seen some lives, but this one... this one has *layers* of disappointment.",
  "Now THAT'S a biography. If you know what I mean.",
  "The network wanted me to say something nice. I've got nothing.",
  "They lived, they died, they made... choices. Let's focus on that."
];

// Introducing the contestants
export const HOST_CONTESTANT_INTROS = [
  "Two brave souls — well, one soul and one algorithm — enter the arena...",
  "They've studied the deceased. They've sharpened their wit. One of them is a robot. Let's begin.",
  "Tonight's contestants have reviewed the evidence and prepared their verbal assault...",
  "The roasters are ready. The ghost is... well, dead. Same as always. Let's go."
];

// Before drafting
export const HOST_DRAFTING_START = [
  "Pick your words wisely. Or don't. I'm not your father. Probably.",
  "The template awaits. The words are yours to choose. Make me proud. Or at least mildly entertained.",
  "Now then... time to craft some devastation.",
  "Choose carefully. These words are the difference between 'brilliant' and 'trying too hard.'",
  "The art of the roast is in the specifics. Be specific. Be cruel. Be *funny*."
];

// When roasts are submitted, judges are deliberating
export const HOST_JUDGING_INTROS = [
  "The roasts have been delivered. Now we wait for our *esteemed* panel to weigh in...",
  "And now, the moment of judgment. The judges are deliberating, which is fancy talk for 'arguing about nothing.'",
  "Let's see what our panel thinks. And remember: they're already dead, so their opinions are eternal.",
  "The judges are reviewing the evidence. I use 'evidence' loosely.",
  "Both roasts are in. Time to see who burned brightest... if you know what I mean."
];

// After each judge scores (reacting to judges)
export const HOST_JUDGE_REACTIONS = [
  "Fascinating take. *Fascinating*.",
  "The judge has spoken. Whether they're right... well, that's above my pay grade.",
  "Noted. Moving on.",
  "Woooonderful feedback. Just delightful.",
  "The scores are in. The drama is... moderate."
];

// Announcing round winner
export const HOST_ROUND_WINNER_PLAYER = [
  "The human takes this round! The machines haven't won yet, folks.",
  "Victory for the breathing contestant! Well done. *Well done indeed.*",
  "You've done it. The ghost has been properly roasted. I'm almost proud.",
  "The round goes to our human competitor. Woooonderful."
];

export const HOST_ROUND_WINNER_AI = [
  "The algorithm strikes! Don't feel bad — they process humor differently.",
  "The AI takes it. Somewhere, a robot is doing a victory dance. Allegedly.",
  "Victory for the machine. Humanity takes another hit. The network is thrilled.",
  "The computer wins this round. It's fine. This is fine."
];

export const HOST_ROUND_TIE = [
  "A tie! How... anticlimactic. Just like my third marriage.",
  "Dead even. Much like our ghost. If you know what I mean.",
  "Neither wins, both lose, the ghost remains roasted. I call that progress.",
  "A draw. The network hates ties. But what are they gonna do, fire me?"
];

// Next round transitions
export const HOST_NEXT_ROUND = [
  "But wait — there's more! Another ghost awaits their humiliation...",
  "On to the next victim. I mean *guest*.",
  "One down, more to go. The afterlife is a busy place.",
  "Round complete. Reset your expectations. Lower them, preferably."
];

// Match end - player wins
export const HOST_MATCH_WIN = [
  "And there it is! A new Ghost Roaster Supreme rises from the... well, wherever you came from. Congratulations.",
  "Victory is yours! You've proven that humans can still out-insult the machines. For now.",
  "The crown goes to the carbon-based life form! Woooonderful. Truly.",
  "You've done it. You've roasted the ghosts. The network is pleased. I'm... mildly impressed."
];

// Match end - AI wins
export const HOST_MATCH_LOSS = [
  "And the machine takes the match. Don't feel bad. They don't have feelings to hurt.",
  "The algorithm wins. Humanity's streak continues... in the wrong direction.",
  "Better luck next time. And there's always a next time. We're eternal here.",
  "The AI claims victory. Somewhere, a very smug computer is doing calculations of joy."
];

// Closing lines
export const HOST_CLOSINGS = [
  "That's a wrap on another ghost... *toast*. I'm Mort Holloway. You've been adequate.",
  "Until next time, keep your roasts hot and your spirits... restless.",
  "I'm Mort Holloway. You've been a beautiful audience. Now get out.",
  "Goodnight, folks. And remember: death is inevitable, but a good joke? *That's eternal.*",
  "Another show in the books. The dead stay dead. The jokes live on. That's showbiz, baby."
