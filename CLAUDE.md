# Roast Mortem - Project Doc

**Version**: 0.4.0

## What This Is
A comedy game where players compete against an AI opponent to craft roasts of "ghosts" (deceased people with humorous bios). Player and AI each get a DIFFERENT random template and draft words to complete their roast. Three randomly selected AI judges score the final jokes.

## Current State
**Working prototype** - Playable at `http://localhost:3000` (run `python3 -m http.server 3000`)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, no framework, no build step
- **Styling**: Plain CSS
- **API**: OpenAI GPT-5.2 (user provides their own API key)
- **Server**: None needed for local dev (just static file serving)
- **Git**: Repo in `ghostroast/` subfolder (connected to GitHub Desktop)

## Architecture Decisions

### Separate Templates
- Player and AI get DIFFERENT random templates each round
- AI picks all its words immediately (random from pools)
- Player sees AI's template structure during drafting
- More RNG/luck-based, opens up roguelike unlock possibilities

### Themed Word Pools (NEW)
- Word pools have `base` entries (always available) and `themed` entries
- Each ghost has theme tags (e.g., `["crypto"]`, `["boomer", "mlm"]`)
- Themed words appear 3x more often when matching ghost is active
- Creates ghost-relevant roast options without guaranteeing them
- Themes: `crypto`, `influencer`, `boomer`, `mlm`, `corporate`, `fitness`, `bro`, `wealth`

### API Key Handling
- User inputs their own OpenAI API key on first launch
- Key stored in localStorage (`roastmortem_apikey`)
- Never hardcoded, never sent anywhere except OpenAI

### Judge System (v0.2.0 - One-at-a-Time Flow)
- Roasts are presented and judged ONE AT A TIME
- Who goes first ALTERNATES each round (playerGoesFirst toggles)
- Each judge gives 2 reactions per round (one per roast)
- 6 API calls per round total (3 judges × 2 roasts)
- On second roast, judges have context of their first reaction (but scores are LOCKED)
- Judges within each roast phase see prior judges' reactions
- Judge order shuffled each round
- Judges evaluate COMPLETE jokes holistically with 25-50 word reactions
- Results screen shows both reactions per judge side-by-side

### Host System
- Mort Holloway hosts the show with typewriter dialogue
- Dialogue templates for every moment (openings, intros, reactions, closings)
- Adds personality and pacing between game phases
- **Player-aware dialogue (v0.3.0)**: Host references player stats, win streaks, opponent history

### Player Profile & Stats System (v0.3.0)
- Player enters their stage name on first play
- Stats persisted in localStorage (`roastmortem_stats`)
- Tracks:
  - Total wins/losses and round wins/losses
  - Win/loss record vs each opponent
  - Average score from each judge
  - Ghosts roasted (unique)
  - Highest single round score
  - Win streaks (current and longest)
  - Last 10 match history
- Host references stats in opening dialogue:
  - New player intros
  - Hot streak callouts (3+ wins)
  - Underdog encouragement
  - Rematch rivalries

## Game Flow
```
API KEY SCREEN
  User enters OpenAI API key (stored in localStorage)
  ↓
PLAYER NAME SCREEN (v0.3.0)
  Enter stage name (persisted with stats)
  ↓
MENU → START GAME (or VIEW STATS)
  ↓
Pick random opponent (from 10)
Pick 3 random judges (from 12)
Set scores to 0-0, round to 1
  ↓
MATCH OPENING (HOST)
  Mort welcomes player BY NAME with stat-aware intro

  Player clicks blanks, picks words from WEIGHTED pools
  (Ghost-themed words appear more often)
  ↓
  === ONE-AT-A-TIME JUDGING (v0.2.0) ===
  ↓
  FIRST ROAST PRESENTATION
  Host introduces first roaster (alternates each round)
  First roast types out dramatically
  ↓
  FIRST ROAST JUDGING
  Host transitions → Each judge scores (25-50 word reactions)
  Scores locked immediately
  ↓
  SECOND ROAST PRESENTATION
  Host introduces second roaster
  Second roast types out dramatically
  ↓
  SECOND ROAST JUDGING

- "I'd call you [X], but even that has [Y]"
- "You [X] like someone who [Y]"
- "[X] called — they want [Y] back"
- "You peaked [X] — and honestly, [Y]"
- etc.

### Word Pools (500+ words across 30+ categories)
Structure: `{ base: [...], themed: { crypto: [...], boomer: [...], ... } }`

**Pool categories**:
- pathetic_things, it_shows
- mild_insults, at_least
- verbs, tragic_backstories
- energy_types, specifically
- what_you_think, what_you_are
- bad_things, good_by_comparison
- has_a_point, just_what
- who_called, what_they_want
- best_sarcastic, worst_real
- peaked_when, peaked_commentary
- specific_energies, energy_consequences
- abstract_concepts, be_you_how
- things_that_fail, bad_outcomes
- disappointed_people, disappointed_actions
- types_of_failure, failure_elaboration
- they_say, youre_proof

### Opponents (10)
AI opponent names/emojis (cosmetic only, same random word selection for all).

### Host: Mortimer "Mort" Holloway 🎩
The eternal host of Roast Mortem. Key traits:
- Former 1970s Vegas MC who died in 1987 ("a gentleman's exit")
- Smooth baritone, draws out words: "Goooood evening"
- Death puns constantly, winks at no one, holds martini that's never empty/full
- References "the network" (afterlife corporate structure)
- Dialogue templates in `data/host.js` for every moment

## Known Issues / TODO

### Needs Work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness could be better
- [ ] No sound effects or animations beyond basic transitions
- [ ] Could add more ghost themes (nerd, spiritual, etc.)

### Completed Recently
- [x] **Rebrand to Roast Mortem (v0.4.0)** - New name, updated localStorage keys, all branding
- [x] **Player profile system** - Name input screen, stats displayed on menu/end screens
- [x] **Comprehensive stats tracking** - Wins, losses, streaks, judge averages, opponent records
- [x] **Stats display screen** - Accessible from menu, shows all player stats
- [x] **Player-aware host dialogue** - Mort references stats, rematches, hot streaks
- [x] **Player name throughout UI** - Shows player name instead of "YOU" everywhere
- [x] Templates rewritten for better joke structure (2 slots, punchier)
- [x] Word pools massively expanded (500+ words)
- [x] Ghost-themed word weighting system
- [x] Judge prompts improved for holistic joke evaluation
- [x] Removed confusing bonus scoring system
- [x] Upgraded to GPT-5.2
- [x] Added version number display
- [x] Git repo setup

### Future Ideas
- Roguelike progression (unlock templates, ghosts, judges)
- Template rarities/power levels
- Multiplayer (real-time PvP)
- More ghosts / ghost packs (themed collections)
- Sound effects / crowd reactions
- Daily ghost mode
- Tournament mode
- Cloudflare deployment

## Module Structure

```
js/main.js          → imports render.js, game.js → calls render()
js/render.js        → imports state.js, utils.js, game.js (bindEvents), data/host
js/game.js          → imports state.js, utils.js, api.js, data/*
                    → has buildWeightedPool() for themed word selection
js/api.js           → imports state.js (for API key), uses GPT-5.2
js/state.js         → game state, VERSION, API key + player stats (localStorage)
js/utils.js         → standalone (shuffle, $, typeText, delay)
data/index.js       → re-exports all data files
```

Note: Circular dependency between render.js and game.js is solved by injecting render function via `setRenderFunction()` in main.js.

---

## Git Workflow

The actual git repo is in `ghostroast/` subfolder. To commit changes:

```bash
# From roastaghost/ directory:
rsync -av --exclude='.git' --exclude='ghostroast' --exclude='.DS_Store' . ghostroast/
cd ghostroast
git add -A
git commit -m "Your message"
# Push via GitHub Desktop or: git push
```

---

## How to Resume Work

1. Read this doc for context
2. Run `python3 -m http.server 3000` in project directory
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`
4. Enter OpenAI API key when prompted
5. Key files:
   - `js/game.js` - Game logic and flow (includes weighted pool selection)
   - `js/render.js` - UI rendering
   - `js/api.js` - Judge prompts and GPT-5.2 calls
   - `data/*.js` - All content (ghosts with themes, templates, word pools)
   - `style.css` - Styling

---

## Design Principles

1. **Keep it simple** - No framework, no build step, easy to hack on
2. **Modular data** - Word pools are reusable, templates reference pools
3. **Distinct judges** - Each has unique voice, never bleed into each other
4. **Show-like presentation** - Host adds personality, typewriter adds drama
5. **Fun first** - Prioritize funny combinations over technical elegance
6. **RNG creates moments** - Different templates = unexpected matchups
7. **Ghost-relevant options** - Themed words make roasts feel specific without forcing it
